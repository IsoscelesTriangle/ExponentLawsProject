# What are exponents?

> Before diving into the individual laws that govern exponents, you should first understand what exponents are. Feel free to leave this page and look at any of the other pages for a detailed explanation of each exponent law with examples and detailed solutions.

​	Exponents are a fancy way of expressing a number that is multiplied by itself multiple times. For example 10<sup>5</sup> would yeild the same result as `10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10`. When reading exponents you wouldn't say *"ten times ten time ten times…"* instead you would say *"Ten to the fifth power."* or *"Ten to the power of five."*
