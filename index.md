# What are exponents?

> ​	Before diving into the individual laws that govern exponents, you should first understand what exponents are. Feel free to jump to any section of this page and view a detailed explanation of each exponent law with examples and detailed solutions.

​	Exponents are a fancy way of expressing a number that is multiplied by itself multiple times. For example $10^5$ would yeild the same result as $10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10$. When reading exponents you wouldn't say *"ten times ten time ten times…"* instead you would say *"Ten to the fifth power."* or *"Ten to the power of five."*

## Exponent Laws

###Multiplication & Division Laws

#### Multipication

$$
a^m \cdot a^n=a^{m+n}
$$



#### Division

$$
{a^m\over a^n}=a^{m-n}
$$



###A Power to a Power Law

$$
(a^m)^n=a^{m \cdot n}
$$



###Negative and Zero Laws 

#### Negative

$$
a^{-n}={1 \over a^n}
$$



#### Zero

$$
a^0=1
$$
