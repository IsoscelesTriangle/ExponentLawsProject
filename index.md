# What are exponents?

> ​	Before diving into the individual laws that govern exponents, you should first understand what exponents are. Feel free to jump to any section of this page and view a detailed explanation of each exponent law with examples and detailed solutions.

​	Exponents are a fancy way of expressing a number that is multiplied by itself multiple times. For example ![](/Users/19xsmitholvera/Documents/GitHub/ExponentLawsProject/images/tentothefifthsimp.gif) would yeild the same result as ![](images/tentothefifth.gif) When reading exponents you wouldn't say *"ten times ten time ten times…"* instead you would say *"Ten to the fifth power."* or *"Ten to the power of five."*
